# Contributing
OpenTerrace is all open-source and contributions are most welcome.

- Smaller contributions fitting nicely into the existing modelling framework (e.g. a new fluid or bed material). These can be included by a simple pull request to the development branch.
- Larger contributions requiring revision of existing classes or core functionality. Please [reach out](https://openterrace.github.io/openterrace-python/contact/) beforehand to discuss.

## Students
Students are invited to help developing OpenTerrace. If you are a student and want to write a semester project within thermal energy storage using OpenTerrace, you are more than welcome to [reach out](https://openterrace.github.io/openterrace-python/contact/).
