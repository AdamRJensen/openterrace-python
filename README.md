Open Terrace is a pure Python framework for thermal energy storage packed bed simulations. It is built from the ground up to be flexible and extendable on modern Python 3.9 with speed in mind. It utilises CUDA to harness the power of modern GPUs and has automatic fallback to CPU.

Open Terrace uses awesome open-source software such as
[Numba](https://numba.pydata.org), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [SciPy](https://scipy.org/):grey_exclamation:
## Why Open Terrace?

- **FAST**. By making use of modern compilers, Open Terrace approaches speeds of C or FORTRAN code.
- **FLEXIBLE**. Open Terrace is built from the ground up to be flexible and allow storage systems to be included.
- **EXTENDABLE**. Modules for different materials such as non-sperical rocks or exotic Phase Change Materials (PCM) can easily be included.

## Want to contribute?

Contributions are welcome :pray: Feel free to send pull requests or get in touch with me to discuss how to collaborate.

### A student?
Want to contribute to a green society built on renewables? We offer several student projects within thermal storage. Please get in touch to discuss the content of a project that suits your background. Also, you will get the chance to be added as a contributor to OpenTerrace should you develop any extensions.
