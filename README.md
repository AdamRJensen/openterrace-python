Open Terrace is a pure Python framework for thermal energy storage packed bed simulations. It is built from the ground up to be flexible and extendable on modern Python 3.9 with speed in mind. It utilises Nvidia CUDA cores to harness the power of modern GPUs and has automatic fallback to CPU cores.

Open Terrace uses awesome open-source software such as
[Numba](https://numba.pydata.org), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [SciPy](https://scipy.org/):grey_exclamation:

## Why Open Terrace?
- **FAST**  
By making use of modern compilers and optimised tri-diagonal matrix solvers, Open Terrace approaches the speed of compiled C or FORTRAN code with the added convenience of easy-to-read Python language.

- **FLEXIBLE**  
Open Terrace is built from the ground up to be flexible to allow for integration in system models or optimisation loops.

- **EXTENDABLE**  
Modules for new materials such as non-spherical rocks or exotic Phase Change Materials (PCM) can easily be plugged into the framework of Open Terrace.
