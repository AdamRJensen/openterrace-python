# Summary

Being able to store energy for extended periods of time is important for a modern societies where increasing amounts of energy comes from renewable sources with time-varying production. Many storage technologies exist but storing energy in the form of thermal energy is a promising, cheap and efficient solution. 

A fluid is heated up when there is a surplus of electricity and pumped through a storage tank. The storage tank is either empty or filled with a bedding material (known as a packed bed). The bedding material could range from regular, readily available stones to more exotic capsules of phase-change material encapsulated in a plastic shell. In either case the hot fluid transfers energy to the bed material, which then stores the energy in form of sensible and/or latent heat. The process is simply reversed to extract energy from the bed material.

# Statement of need

`OpenTerrace` is an open-source simulation framework for thermal storage packed bed simulations. Predicting transient temperature profiles in both fluid and bed phases is not straight forward numerically due to the complexity of the physics involved. The problem is governed by a set of coupled, non-linear, partial differential equations (convection-diffusion). The framework allows new shape functions, substances (including phase-changing substances), source terms and numerical schemes to easily be added, which makes it a versatile tool to test out new ideas. The core part of the computations are made by calling low-level languages using packages such as NumPy [@harris], SciPy [@virtanen] and  Numba [@lam] for speed while maintaining the flexibility and user-friendliness of Python. Matplotlib [@hunter] is used for static plots and animations.

`OpenTerrace` comes with a range of tutorials that highlights its functionality as well as unittests

`OpenTerrace` serves different purposes. First, it was designed to be used by both researchers doing research projects and industry making design decisions. Also, it has now proven useful for engineering students working on semester projects. Here the framework allows students to gain insight into energy storage while practising Python programming.
