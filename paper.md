# Summary

Being able to store energy for extended periods is important for a modern societies where increasing amounts of energy comes from renewable sources with time-varying production. Many storage technologies exist but storing energy in the form of thermal energy is a promising, cheap and efficient solution. 

A fluid is heated up when there is a surplus of electricity and led through a storage tank. The storage tank is either empty or filled with a bedding material that forms a porous zone. The bedding material could range from regular, readily available stones to more exotic capsules of phase-change material  encapsulated in a plastic shell. In either case the hot fluid transfers energy to the bed material, which then stores the energy in the form of sensible and/or latent heat. The process is simply reversed to extract energy from the bed material.

# Statement of need

Predicting temperature profiles in both fluid and material phases is not straight forwarde numerically due to the complexity of the physics and underlying set of coupled, non-linear, partial differential equations (convection-diffusion). `OpenTerrace` solves the set of equations in a numerically efficient manner by calling low-level languages for speed while still maintaining flexibility and user-friendliness of Python. Users may easily add new substances (including phase change) to be used for the fluid or bed phase. Both the storage tank and the bed material may be of different shape and size and  The bed material void fraction may vary spatially in the storage tank. All is implemented in a way that allows the code to be extended with new shapes and substances.

`OpenTerrace` is a simulation framework for thermal storage packed bed simulations. It enables calls to  It solves the advection-diffusion equation fin the fluid phase and the diffusion equation in the bed material. These may be coupled and source terms be easily be added to account various effects such as heat loss to surroundings. Also, various materials, fluid and shapes are implemented in a generic manner, which allows users to easily test different combinations and extend it capabilities.

`OpenTerrace` was designed to be used by both researchers doing research projects, industry making design decisions and engineering students with interests in energy storage.

# Mathematics

Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$

You can also use plain \LaTeX for equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
\hat f(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{i\omega x} dx
\end{equation}
and refer to \autoref{eq:fourier} from text.
