# Student projects
Students are invited to help developing OpenTerrace.

## Ideas for projects
- Implement new discretisation schemes and benchmark them
- Implement new correlations for e.g. convective heat transfer in porous media
- Benchmark and optimise the code
- Investigate new types of thermal storage systems by adding different fluids and or materials (also phase change materials)
