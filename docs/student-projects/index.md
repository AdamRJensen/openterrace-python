# Project proposals

Want to contribute to a green society built on renewables? We offer several student projects within thermal energy storage. 

In the menu you can find project proposals that suit students on different levels. Please get in touch with the respective supervisors listed on the proposals for more details or to discuss the content of a project. We are looking for all kind of studies including:

- System level integrating thermal storage systems in larger systems
- CFD studies looking into how energy is transferred to/from the bed material
- Heat transfer studies dealing with reduced order models
- Optimisation studies focusing on operating thermal energy storage systems
- Experimental studies with the purpose of code validation
- General improvements of the code
