OpenTerrace is all open-source and contributions are most welcome. There are different ways to contribute to OpenTerrace:

- Smaller contributions fitting into the existing modelling framework (e.g. a new fluid or bed material) can be created as pull request directly.
- For larger contributions requiring revision of existing classes please get in touch before you start rewriting code..
- If you intend to use the modelling framework and require any assistance please also get in touch.
