# Contributing to OpenTerrace

OpenTerrace is all open-source and contributions are most welcome.

## Code development
- Smaller contributions fitting nicely into the existing modelling framework (e.g. a new fluid or bed material). These can be included by a simple pull request to the development branch.
- Larger contributions requiring revision of existing classes or core functionality. Please reach out beforehand to discuss.
- If you intend to use OpenTerrace in product development or research and require any assistance you are also most welcome to [get in touch](contact.md).

## Collaborations
OpenTerrace welcomes collaborations within packed bed thermal storage systems. Please [get in touch](contact.md) to discuss further.
