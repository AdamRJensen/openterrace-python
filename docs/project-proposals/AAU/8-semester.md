### Proposal 1: Optimisation of operation strategies
In this project a numerical 1-dimensional transient model should of a storage tank should be developed. As the electricity price varies throughout the day, the charge and discharge periods of the thermal energy storage packed bed tank should be adjusted accordingly. Due to highly non-linear problem a genetic-type optimisation algorithm should be applied.
