### Proposal 1: Validation of thermal energy storage models using small scale lab tests
In this project a numerical 1-dimensional model should be developed to predict temperature profiles in the tank over time. A small test rig should be developed in lab to validate the simulations. In the test rig, temperatures should be recorded at different positions in the tank.
