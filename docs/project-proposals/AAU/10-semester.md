### Predicting instabilities
In this project a numerical 2-dimensional transient model should of a storage tank should be developed. When using stones as bed material and hot air as carrier fluid, we may observe instabilities that complicates the operation of the tank. As the viscosity increases with temperature, the air tend to flow where the temperature is low in the tank. Therefore, if a flow passage of cold air is created, the air tends to flow here and parts of the bed material will become inactive. More details can be found here <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2018.07.015>

In this project this phonemon should be investigated in more details by a numerical model.
