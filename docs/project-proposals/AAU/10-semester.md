### Proposal 1: Predicting instabilities
In this project a numerical 2-dimensional transient model should of a storage tank should be developed. When using stones as bed material and hot air as carrier fluid, we may observe instabilities that complicates the operation of the tank. As the viscosity increases with temperature, the air tend to flow where the temperature is low in the tank. Therefore, if a flow passage of cold air is created, the air tends to flow here and parts of the bed material will become inactive. More details can be found here <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2018.07.015>

In this project this phonemon should be investigated in more details by a numerical model.

### Proposal 2: Utilising phase change materials for efficient energy storage
In this project a 1- or 2-dimensional transient model of phase change materials should be developed. Recent advances in technology for packed beds utilise phase change materials (PCM) that change from solid to liquid around 50 degree celcius. Due to the high latent heat associated with the phase change, these materials are beneficial to when a constant outlet temperature of the tank is needed. The aim of this project is to develop a simple numerical model in Python and validate it using more sofisticated CFD models available in OpenFOAM. More details about a simplified model for phase change can be found here <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2012.04.053>
