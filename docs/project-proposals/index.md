# Project proposals

Want to contribute to a green society built on renewables? We offer several student projects within thermal energy storage. In the menu you may find project proposals that suit different semesters. Please get in touch to discuss the content of a project that suits your background and learning goals. We are looking for all kind of studies including:

- System level integrating thermal storage systems in larger systems
- CFD studies looking into how energy is transferred to/from the bed material
- Heat transfer studies dealing with reduced order models
- Optimisation studies focusing on operating thermal energy storage systems
- Experimental studies with the purpose of code validation
- General improvements of the code
