# Contributing as a student
Want to contribute to a green society built on renewables? We offer several student projects within thermal energy storage. Please get in touch to discuss the content of a project that suits your background and learning goals. We are looking for all kind of studies including:

- System level integrating thermal storage systems in larger systems
- CFD studies looking into conjugate heat transfer
- Heat transfer studies dealing with reduced order models
- Experimental studies with the purpose of code validation
- General improvements of the code

In either case, you will be added as a contributor of Open Terrace if you develop an extension that makes its way into the code base.
